So, on my computer, I would run the following commands to create a directory (folder) called projects within my documents folder and clone a repo there.

Open terminal
cd documents (Not case sensitive on mac)
mkdir projects
cd projects
git clone https://github.com/seanbecker15/wherecanifindit.git
cd wherecanifindit (if I want to go into the directory)
p.s. wherecanifindit is just the name of my git repository, not a command!
